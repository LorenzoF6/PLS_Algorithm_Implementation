## Descrption
Implementation of the PLS algorithm through a MATLAB class which allows:
* to estimate the classification model using the NIPALS algorithm;
* to validate and cross-validate it by providing some performance metrics;
* to predict new instances starting from the trained model;
* to calculate the best reduction order;
* to perform a comparison with the PCA technique.

link[Scripts\Data_analysis.mlx] contains an application example of the PLS.m class
